Q8. In what order will the numbers 1-4 be logged to the console when the code below is executed? Why?

(function() {

    console.log(1); 

    setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000); 

    setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0); 

    console.log(4);

})();

Solution:- The numbers 1, 4, 3, and 2 will be logged to the console in the following order:

1. `console.log(1);`: This line logs the number 1 to the console immediately when the script is executed.

2. `console.log(4);`: This line logs the number 4 to the console immediately after the first log (1) because it is a synchronous operation.

3. `setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);`: This line schedules the function `console.log(3)` to be executed after 0 milliseconds. Despite the delay being 0, it is still an asynchronous operation. Asynchronous tasks are executed after the synchronous code has finished executing. Therefore, the number 3 is logged to the console after 1 and 4.

4. `setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);`: This line schedules the function `console.log(2)` to be executed after 1000 milliseconds (1 second). Since this is also an asynchronous operation and there is a delay of 1000 milliseconds, the number 2 is logged last, after 1, 4, and 3.

So, the final order of the numbers logged to the console will be: 1, 4, 3, and 2.
