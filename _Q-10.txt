Ques 10: What will the following code's output be in sequence and explain why?
function printNumber(num) {

  console.log(num);

}


console.log(1);


setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);


setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);


console.log(4);



Solution:

The output sequence of the code will be as follows:

```
1
4
2
3
```

Explanation:

1. `console.log(1);`: This line logs the number 1 to the console immediately when the script starts executing.

2. `console.log(4);`: This line logs the number 4 to the console after the first log (1) because it is a synchronous operation.

3. `setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);`: This line schedules the function `printNumber` to be executed with the argument `2` after 0 milliseconds. Despite the delay being 0, it is still an asynchronous operation. However, since the delay is 0, the `printNumber` function with the argument `2` is added to the microtask queue (job queue) immediately after the current synchronous execution context finishes.

4. `setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);`: This line schedules the function `printNumber` to be executed with the argument `3` after 100 milliseconds. As this is also an asynchronous operation with a delay of 100 milliseconds, the `printNumber` function with the argument `3` is added to the macro task queue (timer queue).

After the synchronous code execution is finished, the event loop moves to the next phase, where it checks the microtask queue first. In this case, it finds the `printNumber` function with the argument `2` waiting in the microtask queue and logs the number 2 to the console. Now the microtask queue is empty.

Next, the event loop checks the macro task queue. It finds the `printNumber` function with the argument `3` waiting there and logs the number 3 to the console. After that, the macro task queue is empty.

Thus, the final output sequence is: 1, 4, 2, 3.
